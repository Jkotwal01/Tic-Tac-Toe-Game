# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple, interactive web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on the same device. The game includes a "Reset Game" button to restart the game, and a "New Game" button to start over after a winner is determined.

## Features

- Playable Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
- Displays the winner message when a player wins.
- Option to reset the game or start a new game after a winner is declared.
- Mobile-responsive design.

    ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Play

1. Click on any of the empty boxes on the grid to make your move.
2. The first player uses 'X', and the second player uses 'O'.
3. The game ends when a player aligns 3 of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. If you wish to play again, click the "New Game" button to start a new round, or click the "Reset Game" button to reset the game.
